Description: IFOMITTED is to ISOMITTED as IFERROR is to ISERROR

Parameters:
- arg: The argument of a lambda function which we want to check whether it has been omitted or not.

- [else]: If arg is not omitted, but we don't want to simply return arg, but some function of arg or any
other expression, we can provide the expression to this optional else parameter.
